### Some words at the start

This project makes heavy use of the third party program [Blender](http://www.blender.org) during the modeling and animation phase although it is not bound to that. Blender is a "free and open source 3D animation suite" without any fees or costs. You can get the latest version of the softare [here](http://www.blender.org/download/).

Depending on your use of this mod you might have to install several plugins that are part of the workflow. You can get those with this repository [at the download section](https://github.com/WorldSEnder/MCAnm/releases).

### How to use

Models and animations are present in binary form in any asset pack or the mod-included assets. You can then use Loader-classes to load and later use them. More on that can be found on the wiki which also provides a tutorial how to make your own personal models and animations and offers references (e.g. file specifications) for other modders/scripters to build on.
